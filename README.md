# skaa_editor

Currently, you can load most (all?) unit-type sprites (ballista, catapult, etc). You have to first load a pallet (Edit>>Load Pallet, choose pal_std.res or pal_win.res) and then choose a SPR file to load via the button on the right-hand side. Read the red text on the right of the window to learn about the mini frame viewer. It'll load all the frames and allow you to browse them in the mini-box but the only thing that is loaded in the edit area, for now, is the first frame.

Eventually, I'll merge the bit of work I've got done on the SAV game files with this. One of the primary devs also wrote a map generator that would be nice to have included in a monolithic trainer.

Saving isn't yet implemented.
