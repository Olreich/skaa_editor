# skaa_editor
Round 2 of a 7KAA binary editor.

Eventually, I'll merge the bit of work I've got done on the SAV game files with this. One of the primary devs also wrote a map generator that would nice to have included in a single overall trainer.

If there's one thing I've always hated about programming and technology, it's graphic arts. This project isn't changing my mind any... going through C++ that was translated from ASM and trying to write C# is painful.
